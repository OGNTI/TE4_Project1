GetRand() between sand or forest generation
forests catch on fire on damage, doing 1 fire damage per round to afflicted target
sand creates smoke on damage, preventing attack from cell
when player unit dies, create broken counterpart to act as mountain - but flyers can still pass through it
add flying

next probably add death and game over first

add remains to the enemies no path part, let them identfy remains blocking them like mountains

melee enemies have nothing to do if player in ocean -- add with attack types, line

actually add the different attack types -- pretty much done

possibly add a text event box with a queue of strings that describes what happens


add ranged player attack -- fixed

problem, ranged enemies don't avoid each others attacks and also don't update them
